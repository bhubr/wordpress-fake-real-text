# Fake Real Text plugin for WordPress

- Contributors: me (BenoÃ®t Hubert)
- Site URL: https://developpeur-web-toulouse.fr/

This plugin generates content (posts, comments, categories, tags) in order to populate a WordPress site. It generates
"real" text, not lorem ipsum.


## Description

The motivation for this plugin was to create a large amount of content, in order to test my React-based WordPress theme
(which is still in progress).

I gave [FakerPress](https://wordpress.org/plugins/fakerpress/) a try, and though it's really nice, it uses lorem ipsum,
and doesn't handle multilingual content.

Since I will use this theme for a WPML-powered multilingual site, I wanted to generate posts in all active languages,
not only the blog's main language.

## Download, installation and usage

This section describes how to get and install the plugin, and where to go next.

Two options are available in order to install this plugin.

1. The easy way. Since I haven't submitted it yet to the WordPress plugins repository, I made it available on my site, on
[this page](https://developpeur-web-toulouse.fr/wordpress-fake-real-text-plugin/).
  a. Get the latest plugin Zip archive.
  b. Change directory to your WordPress's `wp-content/plugins` directory.
  c. Unzip it.
2. The geek way:
  a. Change directory to your WordPress's `wp-content/plugins` directory.
  b. Clone this repository: `git clone https://github.com/bhubr/wordpress-fake-real-text.git fake-real-text`.
  c. Run `composer install`. Well, of course you know about [Composer](https://getcomposer.org).

Then you must activate it, either from WordPress's admin extensions page, or via [WP-CLI](http://wp-cli.org/).

Once done, the plugin screen is available via the "Tools >> Fake Real" Text menu entry.
